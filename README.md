# AI Code Review Assistant

This project automates the **code review process** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as **Codex** or **CodeBERT**. It checks for common coding errors, security vulnerabilities, and best practices.

## Features:
- Upload a code file (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++) for automatic review.
- The system checks for potential errors, security issues, and suggests improvements.
- Powered by pre-trained LLMs like Codex.

## Setup:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shashwat1729/AI-Code-Review-Assistant.git
   cd AI-Code-Review-Assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to upload code for review.

## Example Use Case:
- Upload a Python script, and the system will generate a review, pointing out errors, vulnerabilities, and coding best practices.
